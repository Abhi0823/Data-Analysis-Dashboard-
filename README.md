Working of the Project

The project starts with data collection, where the Prime Video dataset is imported into Power BI. Using Power Query, missing values are handled, and necessary transformations are applied, such as changing data types, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistency. This step ensures clean and structured data for analysis.

Next, the data model is built by defining relationships between different tables. Calculated columns and measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) are created to derive meaningful insights, such as total titles, ratings distribution, and content trends.

Once the data is prepared, the visualization process begins. The dashboard is designed with interactive charts and graphs:
✔ KPI Cards display total titles, genres, ratings, and directors.
✔ Bar Charts visualize ratings and genre distribution.
✔ Map Visualization represents country-wise content availability.
✔ Pie Chart shows the ratio of movies vs. TV shows.
✔ Line Chart tracks content production trends over time.

Filters and slicers are added to make the dashboard interactive, allowing users to explore data dynamically. Proper formatting, color themes, and tooltips enhance usability.

Finally, the dashboard is optimized for performance, ensuring smooth data interactions. Future improvements may include predictive analytics using Python and machine learning to forecast trends in the streaming industry. This project provides valuable insights into Prime Video's content trends, helping understand audience preferences and streaming patterns.
